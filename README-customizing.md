# Customizing

You can customize this theme without editing core files or using a preprocessor. 
To add customizations, simply override one or more of the variables found 
in `[variables.css](components/variables.css)` in your own stylesheet.

For example, you can customize the default text color and background like this:

```css
:root {
  --body-color: white;
  --body-bg-color: black;
}
```

### Using Variables

You can use any of this theme's variables in your stylesheet. 
This makes it easy to reuse values without hardcoding them. 
It also provides a foundation for extending the components of this theme.

.your-selector {
  color: var(--state-danger);
}
```

Refer to `[variables.css](components/variables.css)` for a complete list of variables in this theme.

If you’re not familiar with CSS variables, 
[this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) will bring you up to speed. 
There’s also an [interactive demo](https://codepen.io/claviska/pen/NvGVYM?editors=1100) if you want to try it out.

### Custom Components

You can create custom components to extend this theme's functionality. 
Here are some best practices to keep things consistent and easy for others to understand.

**Familiarize yourself with the naming conventions.
** A custom accordion component, for example, would have a class name such as `accordion`, 
modifier classes such as `accordion-open`, and variable names that look like 
`--accordion-bg-color`. Try to follow similar patterns as much as possible.

**Define new variables when it makes sense to.
** Take a look at `[variables.css](components/variables.css)` to see how existing components 
are defined. Many use core variables instead of hardcoded properties as default values. 
This makes it easy for users to customize things quickly, but still provides enough 
flexibility to style individual components.

**Semantic markup is strongly encouraged.
** Custom components should use the most appropriate elements and the minimal amount of markup 
required.

**Keep everything together.
** During development, each component should be in its own folder along with its 
stylesheets, scripts, and documentation. Components shouldn’t depend on other 
components’ styles or scripts. This makes it easier to add or remove components 
from your app without affecting others. Of course, it’s perfectly fine to bundle 
components for optimization purposes in production.
