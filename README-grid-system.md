# Grid System

This doesn't have a grid system because [you donâ€™t need one](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/01/you-do-not-need-a-css-grid-based-grid-system/README-grid-system.md). 

You should use the [CSS Grid Layout](https://gridbyexample.com/) instead.

If you have an obligation to support older browsers, consider using the Bootstrap grid [without any extras](https://github.com/zirafa/bootstrap-grid-only) in combination with this theme.
