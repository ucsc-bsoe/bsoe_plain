# BSOE Plain
This is the base theme for BSOE sites

## This site is organized into components
If something has more than one asset (css, js, twig, md) then it is in a directory. 
If it's directly in the components folder it is because it has just one file.

## Grids aren't necessary
Learn about Grid System in the [README-grid-system.md](README-grid-system.md) file.

## Sass isn't necessary
Checkout how to customize in the [README-customizing.md](README-customizing.md) file.

## There is documentation on components in the components folder. Check it out!

## Thank you to Shoelace.css
It was initially created with css, docs, images and js from Shoelace.css 

I modified them heavily, but Shoelace.css is responsible for a lot of the heavy lifting.

Thank you Shoelace for all your hard work.
