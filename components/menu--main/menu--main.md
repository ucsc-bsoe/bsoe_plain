# Menu Notes
Main Menu uses smartmenus.
http://vadikom.github.io/smartmenus/src/demo/

This is installed with npm.
As long as you run npm install in main theme, the menu will be installed.

Minified javascript file for menu is included in the bsoe_plain.libraries.yml file.
node_modules/smartmenus/dist/jquery.smartmenus.min.js: {}

It needs to be above the main script.js file.

Also need the small helper function in the js here.
